### SECTION 1: Why GDPR Matters

**H2:** GDPR Compliant AI Marketing – Protecting Your Business

**Intro Paragraph (Focus Keyword at start):**
GDPR Compliant AI Marketing is essential for businesses operating in the EU. According to the [European Commission](https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection_en), GDPR violations can result in fines up to €20 million or 4% of global turnover. Many popular AI marketing tools process data outside the EU, creating compliance risks. Our solutions eliminate these concerns.

**The Compliance Challenge:**
- ⚠️ Most AI tools are US-based (data transfers outside EU)
- ⚠️ Cloud Act allows US government data access
- ⚠️ Privacy Shield invalidated by Schrems II ruling
- ⚠️ Standard contractual clauses may not be sufficient
- ✓ **Solution**: EU-based AI marketing with full GDPR compliance
