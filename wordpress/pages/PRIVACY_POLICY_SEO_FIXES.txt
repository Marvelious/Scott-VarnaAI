## 🚨 CRITICAL BUGS TO FIX FIRST

### Bug 1: Corrupted Q4 FAQ Answer
**Location**: FAQ section, Question 4
**Current (WRONG)**: "Simply contact us at At Varna AI, your trust is our top priority..."
**Should Be**: "Simply contact us at privacy@varnaai.com with your request, and we'll permanently delete all your personal data from our systems within 30 days."

### Bug 2: Duplicate Content After Q4
**Issue**: Entire privacy policy content is duplicated after the Q4 FAQ answer
**Fix**: Delete all content after the proper Q4 answer (everything from the second "At Varna AI, your trust is our top priority" onwards)

## 🔗 EXTERNAL DOFOLLOW LINKS TO ADD (Critical for SEO)

### Link 1: GDPR Official Documentation
**Where to Add**: In paragraph starting with "We adhere to the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)..."
**Current Text**: "We adhere to the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), ensuring..."
**Change To**: "We adhere to the <a href="https://gdpr.eu/what-is-gdpr/" rel="dofollow">General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)</a>, ensuring..."

**Why This Link**: Official GDPR information portal, high authority source for EU data protection

### Link 2: EU AI Act Official Documentation
**Where to Add**: In paragraph starting with "Our AI systems are designed to comply with the EU AI Act..."

**Change To**: "Our AI systems are designed to comply with the <a href="https://artificialintelligenceact.eu/" rel="dofollow">EU AI Act</a>..."

**Why This Link**: Official EU AI Act documentation portal, authoritative source on AI regulation

### Link 3 (Optional but Recommended): EU Data Protection Authorities
**Where to Add**: In the "Your Rights" section or contact information
**Suggested Text Addition**: "You also have the right to lodge a complaint with your <a href="https://edpb.europa.eu/about-edpb/about-edpb/members_en" rel="dofollow">local Data Protection Authority</a>."
**Where**: Add this sentence after the "Your Rights" list, before the FAQ section
