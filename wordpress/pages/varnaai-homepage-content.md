## CONTENT TONE & VOICE GUIDELINES

**Voice Characteristics**:
- **Confident, not arrogant**: "17+ years experience" not "World's best security expert"
- **Technical but accessible**: Use terms like "ISO 27001" but explain "audit-ready documentation in minutes"
- **Personal, not corporate**: "I help" not "We provide", "Book a call with me" not "Contact our team"
- **Bulgarian-market aware**: Mention "Bulgarian SMEs", "Bulgarian regulations", "Varna"
- **Value-focused**: Always tie features to outcomes ("€4,900 not €50K+", "6 hours → 22 minutes")

**Avoid**:
- Marketing fluff ("revolutionary", "cutting-edge", "game-changing")
- SaaS subscription language ("pricing tiers", "monthly plans")
- Team language ("our team", "we're hiring") - it's solo consulting
- Generic promises ("best quality", "guaranteed results")
