## Part 2: Schema Markup Strategy

### Implementation by Site Type

#### For Physical Location Sites (Classic Security)
```json
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "LocalBusiness",
  "name": "Classic Security EOOD",
  "address": {
    "@type": "PostalAddress",
    "streetAddress": "...",
    "addressLocality": "Varna",
    "addressCountry": "BG"
  },
  "geo": {
    "@type": "GeoCoordinates",
    "latitude": "...",
    "longitude": "..."
  },
  "telephone": "...",
  "priceRange": "€€€",
  "aggregateRating": {...}
}
```

#### For Online-Only Sites (AI Services)
```json
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "Organization",
  "name": "AI Projektmanager",
  "url": "https://ai-projektmanager.de",
  "logo": "...",
  "sameAs": [
    "https://www.facebook.com/AIProjektmanager/",
    "https://www.linkedin.com/company/ai-projektmanager/",
    "https://twitter.com/AiProjekt"
  ]

## Part 3: Portfolio Cross-Linking Strategy

├── About/Team (Tier 1)

    └── Individual Posts (Tier 2)
```

#### Linking Rules
- **5-10 internal links per 2,000 words**
- **3-click rule**: All pages reachable within 3 clicks from homepage

### Cross-Domain Linking (Portfolio Strategy)

#### Safe Cross-Linking Pattern
```

  → Resources: Link to security guides on classicsecurity.net

varna-agenten.de
  → Case Studies: Reference AI Projektmanager implementations
  → Partners page: List sister companies
  → Blog: Cross-reference relevant content

varnaai.com (Portfolio Hub)
  → Portfolio page: Showcase all properties
  → Service pages: Link to specialized sites
  → About: Company structure including all brands
