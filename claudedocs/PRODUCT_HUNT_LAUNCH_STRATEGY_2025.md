Hallo Product Hunt!

We built AI Projektmanager because German businesses face a unique challenge: they need modern AI-powered tools, but those tools must comply with strict German regulations.

Unlike American PM tools that treat privacy as an afterthought, we built compliance into the core:

- Automatic DSGVO compliance checks on every workflow
- BSI IT-Grundschutz certified infrastructure
- NIS2-ready audit trails
- 100% EU data hosting

We're bootstrapped, profitable, and serving real German enterprises in automotive, banking, and manufacturing.

Would love your feedback! What compliance features matter most to you?

- Zero US data transfers
- Full GDPR compliance built-in
- Ready for EU AI Act requirements

Our customers include Bulgarian startups looking for affordable AI and German enterprises requiring strict DSGVO compliance.

Guten Tag Product Hunt!

German businesses need AI automation, but most AI agent platforms are US-based with no understanding of German compliance requirements.

Varna Agenten is different:

- AI agents trained for German business processes
- DSGVO-compliant from the ground up
- German-language interface and support
- EU data centers only

Our agents handle document processing, workflow orchestration, and intelligent customer service - all while maintaining complete audit trails.

What business processes would you automate with AI agents?

Hey Product Hunt!

Most AI marketing tools collect massive amounts of customer data without considering privacy regulations. That's a liability for EU businesses.

AI Marketing BG does AI marketing differently:

- AI-optimized campaigns with GDPR compliance
- No unauthorized data collection
- Transparent reporting
- EU-based operations

We serve clients from Bulgaria to Germany, combining Bulgarian tech talent with German regulatory expertise.

How important is privacy in your marketing stack?
