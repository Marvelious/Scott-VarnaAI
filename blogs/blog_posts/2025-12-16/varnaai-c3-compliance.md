## GDPR Conformity Through Automation

### Processing Records Under Article 30 GDPR

GDPR NIS2 Compliance Automation creates and updates Records of Processing Activities continuously based on IT system scans and API integrations. The platform automatically detects personal data processing in databases, CRM systems, and cloud services through schema analysis and data flow mapping. Data flow visualization illustrates how personal data transfers between systems, third-party processors, and international recipients.

Each processing activity documents purpose, legal basis, data categories, recipients, retention periods, and technical/organizational measures. The <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/reform/rules-business-and-organisations/obligations/controller-processor/what-data-must-we-include-record_en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">European Commission</a> requires complete and current processing records for all organizations with 250+ employees or processing sensitive data categories.

API integrations with data processors import their security measures automatically into the processing record. Changes to data processing activities trigger automatic record updates with change-tracking and approval workflows. Notifications alert Data Protection Officers about risky new processing operations requiring DPIA assessment.

### Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA)

GDPR NIS2 Compliance Automation automatically assesses whether new processing requires DPIA under Article 35 GDPR using risk scoring algorithms. Risk models analyze data types, processing scale, and potential impacts on data subjects against EDPB guidelines. Scoring algorithms classify risks as low, medium, or high based on systematic monitoring, large-scale sensitive data processing, or automated decision-making criteria.

For high-risk processing, the platform generates complete DPIA reports with risk description, mitigation measures, and residual risk assessment. Consultation workflows enable Data Protection Officer involvement and supervisory authority communication when required. Documentation of all DPIA steps fulfills accountability obligations under Article 5(2) GDPR.

The solution automatically incorporates DPIA blacklists from European supervisory authorities identifying mandatory assessment scenarios. Processing involving systematic behavior monitoring or large-scale sensitive data processing triggers obligatory DPIA execution. Our <a href="/our-mission-secure-ai-solutions/" target="_blank">secure AI mission</a> includes AI-specific risk assessments complying with proposed EU AI Act requirements.

## NIS2 Directive: Requirements and Implementation

### Sector-Specific Compliance Requirements

GDPR NIS2 Compliance Automation automatically identifies whether organizations fall under NIS2 regulation by analyzing sector classification and size thresholds. The NIS2 Directive defines 18 critical sectors: energy, transport, banking, financial market infrastructure, health, drinking water, wastewater, digital infrastructure, ICT service management, public administration, space, postal services, waste management, chemicals, food, manufacturing, digital providers, and research organizations.

Size thresholds (50+ employees or €10M annual turnover) automatically verify against company data from business registries. The platform classifies organizations as essential or important entities based on criticality assessments. Sector-specific checklists ensure all relevant security measures implementation according to Annex I and II requirements.

For supply chain risks, the solution scans dependencies on third-party vendors and assesses their security levels through automated questionnaires. Supply Chain Risk Management dashboards visualize vulnerabilities in the supply chain with criticality scoring. Automatic Vendor Security Assessments request missing compliance evidence from suppliers with deadline tracking.

### Incident Response and Reporting Obligations

GDPR NIS2 Compliance Automation implements automated incident detection with 24/7 monitoring and SIEM integration capabilities. Security event correlation analyzes logs from various sources using machine learning anomaly detection. Pattern recognition identifies unusual activities indicating security incidents requiring NIS2 notification.

Upon detected incidents, the platform triggers automatic workflows: incident documentation, stakeholder notification, escalation processes, and timeline tracking. Timers remind about NIS2 reporting deadlines (24 hours early warning, 72 hours incident notification, 1 month final report). Template-based notifications to national Computer Security Incident Response Teams (CSIRTs) reduce manual effort and ensure completeness.

Post-incident analyses generate lessons-learned reports and improvement recommendations automatically using root cause analysis algorithms. Trend analyses over historical incidents identify recurring vulnerabilities requiring architectural changes. Our platform integrates with major SIEM systems (Splunk, QRadar, Sentinel, ArcSight) for centralized security event management.
