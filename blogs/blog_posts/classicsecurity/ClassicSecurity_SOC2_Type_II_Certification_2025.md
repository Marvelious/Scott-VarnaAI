<h2 class="wp-block-heading">5 Trust Service Criteria Explained</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">1. Security (Mandatory)</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Security criteria protects information and systems against unauthorized access and disclosure. Physical security, logical access controls, encryption, and vulnerability management demonstrate effectiveness. Change management procedures prevent unauthorized system modifications. SOC 2 Type II certification 2025 requires comprehensive security control documentation.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Penetration testing validates security posture annually at minimum. Incident response procedures outline detection, containment, and recovery processes. Security awareness training ensures personnel understand responsibilities. Organizations must demonstrate consistent security control operation throughout audit period.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">2. Availability (Optional)</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Availability criteria ensures systems remain accessible for operation and use. Service level agreements commit to specific uptime percentages. Disaster recovery planning enables business continuity during outages. SOC 2 Type II certification 2025 validates availability through operational evidence.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Redundancy in infrastructure components prevents single points of failure. Backup testing verifies restoration procedures work when needed. Monitoring systems detect availability degradation proactively. <a href="https://classicsecurity.net/about" target="_blank">Our team</a> designs resilient architectures meeting availability commitments.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">3. Confidentiality (Optional)</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Confidentiality criteria protects information designated as confidential by policy or agreement. Non-disclosure agreements formalize confidentiality commitments legally. Data classification systems identify which information requires protection. Access restrictions limit confidential data to authorized personnel only.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Encryption protects confidential data at rest and in transit comprehensively. Secure disposal procedures prevent unauthorized disclosure through improper deletion. SOC 2 Type II certification 2025 demonstrates consistent confidentiality control operation.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">4. Processing Integrity (Optional)</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Processing integrity ensures system processing is complete, valid, accurate, timely, and authorized. Input validation prevents corrupt data from entering systems. Error handling and logging detect processing failures systematically. Reconciliation procedures verify transaction completeness.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Authorization controls ensure only approved transactions process through systems. Output reviews validate processing accuracy before data distribution. SOC 2 Type II certification 2025 confirms processing integrity through continuous monitoring evidence.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">5. Privacy (Optional)</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

Privacy notices inform individuals about data practices transparently. Consent mechanisms enable choice over personal information usage.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Type I vs Type II: Critical Differences</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>SOC 2 Type I reports assess control design at specific point in time. Auditors verify controls exist as documented without operational testing. Type I provides initial compliance snapshot for newly designed systems. SOC 2 Type II certification 2025 requires operational effectiveness demonstration.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Type II audits observe control operation for minimum 3-month period. Evidence collection spans entire observation period proving consistent application. Auditors test whether controls operated effectively throughout timeframe. Customers value Type II significantly higher as operational proof.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>First-time certification typically begins with Type I establishing baseline. Organizations remediate control gaps before committing to Type II observation. <a href="https://sprinto.com/blog/soc-2-certification-complete-guide/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sprinto certification guides</a> recommend 6-12 months preparation before Type II audit. SOC 2 Type II certification 2025 demonstrates mature security program operation.</p>
