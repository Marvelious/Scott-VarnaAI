<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The EU AI Act: What Bulgarian Companies Must Know</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>EU AI Act Bulgarian business compliance represents the next major regulatory challenge for companies using artificial intelligence. As the world's first comprehensive AI regulation, the EU AI Act establishes binding requirements that Bulgarian organizations must meet to deploy AI systems legally within the European market.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With phased implementation beginning in 2024 and full enforcement by 2027, Bulgarian businesses using AI face significant compliance obligations. Our <a href="https://varnaai.com/c3-compliance-platform-nis2-deadline/" target="_blank">C3 Compliance Platform</a> helps organizations navigate both AI Act and NIS2 requirements through integrated compliance management.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">EU AI Act Bulgarian Business: Understanding the Risk-Based Approach</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>EU AI Act Bulgarian business compliance requirements depend on the risk level of AI systems used. The regulation categorizes AI applications into four risk tiers, each with different obligations. According to the <a href="https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/regulatory-framework-ai" target="_blank" rel="noopener">European Commission's AI regulatory framework</a>, understanding your AI risk classification is the essential first step.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">EU AI Act Implementation Timeline</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>EU AI Act Bulgarian business compliance follows a phased timeline:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>August 2024</strong>: AI Act entered into force</li>

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:spacer {"height":"30px"} -->
<div style="height:30px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>
<!-- /wp:spacer -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Penalties for Non-Compliance</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>EU AI Act Bulgarian business violations carry substantial penalties:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Prohibited AI practices</strong>: Up to €35 million or 7% of global annual turnover</li>
<li><strong>High-risk AI violations</strong>: Up to €15 million or 3% of global annual turnover</li>
<li><strong>Incorrect information to authorities</strong>: Up to €7.5 million or 1.5% of global annual turnover</li>
</ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For SMEs, fines are calculated at the lower percentage rate to avoid disproportionate impact. However, even reduced penalties can be devastating for smaller Bulgarian businesses.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:spacer {"height":"30px"} -->
<div style="height:30px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>
<!-- /wp:spacer -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">General-Purpose AI Model Requirements</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>EU AI Act Bulgarian business obligations extend to providers of general-purpose AI models (like large language models). These providers must:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Maintain technical documentation</strong>: Including training process and testing procedures</li>
