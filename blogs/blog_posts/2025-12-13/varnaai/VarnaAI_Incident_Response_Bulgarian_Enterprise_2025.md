<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Building Incident Response Capabilities</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Incident response Bulgarian enterprise programs require structured frameworks and dedicated resources:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Incident Response Team</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Designate team members responsible for incident handling. Core team includes IT security, legal, communications, and senior management. Extended team adds HR, business continuity, and external experts. Bulgarian organizations need clear escalation paths and decision authority.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Incident Response Plan</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Documented procedures guide response activities. Plans define incident classification, response procedures, communication templates, and recovery steps. Incident response Bulgarian enterprise plans must address regulatory notification requirements including GDPR and NIS2 obligations.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Detection and Monitoring</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Security monitoring capabilities identify incidents quickly. SIEM systems correlate events across infrastructure revealing suspicious patterns. Endpoint detection and response (EDR) provides visibility into endpoint activity. Bulgarian enterprises need 24/7 monitoring for effective incident detection.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Forensic Capabilities</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Incident investigation requires forensic tools and expertise. Evidence preservation maintains chain of custody for potential legal proceedings. Analysis capabilities determine attack vectors, scope, and timeline. Incident response Bulgarian enterprise forensics support both remediation and regulatory requirements.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Communication Protocols</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Incident communication requires careful management. Internal communication keeps stakeholders informed without causing panic. External communication protects reputation while meeting transparency obligations. Bulgarian organizations need pre-approved communication templates for rapid deployment.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Our <a href="https://varnaai.com/c3-compliance-platform-nis2-deadline/" target="_blank">C3 Compliance Platform</a> helps Bulgarian enterprises maintain incident response readiness through continuous compliance monitoring.</p>

<!-- /wp:spacer -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The Incident Response Lifecycle</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Incident response Bulgarian enterprise activities follow structured lifecycle phases based on the <a href="https://www.nist.gov/cyberframework" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NIST Cybersecurity Framework</a>:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Phase 1: Preparation</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Build capabilities before incidents occur. Train response team members, deploy monitoring tools, and document procedures. Establish relationships with external resources including forensic providers and law enforcement. Preparation determines response effectiveness when incidents occur.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Phase 2: Detection and Analysis</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Identify and validate potential incidents. Security alerts require triage to distinguish true incidents from false positives. Initial analysis determines incident severity, scope, and impact. Incident response Bulgarian enterprise detection must balance speed with accuracy.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Phase 3: Containment</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Stop incident spread while maintaining business operations where possible. Short-term containment limits immediate damage. Long-term containment enables sustained operations during investigation. Bulgarian enterprises balance containment effectiveness against operational disruption.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Phase 4: Eradication</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Remove threat actors and malicious artifacts from environment. Clean systems of malware, close attack vectors, and eliminate attacker persistence mechanisms. Incident response Bulgarian enterprise eradication must be thorough—incomplete eradication enables attacker return.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Phase 5: Recovery</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Restore normal operations carefully. Rebuild or restore affected systems from known-good sources. Monitor recovered systems for signs of continued compromise. Bulgarian organizations phase recovery to manage risk while restoring business capability.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Phase 6: Lessons Learned</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Post-incident review improves future response. Document what happened, what worked, and what needs improvement. Update procedures, controls, and training based on findings. Incident response Bulgarian enterprise improvement requires honest assessment without blame.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:spacer {"height":"30px"} -->

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">GDPR Breach Notification</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Personal data breaches require notification to Bulgarian CPDP within 72 hours. Notifications describe breach nature, affected individuals, likely consequences, and mitigation measures. High-risk breaches require direct individual notification. Documentation requirements apply even for breaches not requiring notification.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">NIS2 Incident Reporting</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Essential and important entities face specific incident reporting requirements. Early warning within 24 hours, incident notification within 72 hours, and final report within one month. Incident response Bulgarian enterprise NIS2 compliance requires rapid detection and reporting capabilities.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Sector-Specific Requirements</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Financial services, healthcare, and critical infrastructure face additional notification requirements. Bulgarian organizations must understand sector-specific obligations beyond general frameworks. Multiple reporting obligations may apply to single incidents.</p>
