<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Why Bulgarian SMEs Need Automated Compliance Solutions</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bulgaria ranks last in the EU for digital adoption at just 29.3% compared to the 54.6% European average.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Bulgarian Commission for Personal Data Protection at <a href="https://www.cpdp.bg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CPDP Bulgaria</a> has increased enforcement activities significantly. Our <a href="/enterprise-cybersecurity-solutions/" target="_blank">enterprise cybersecurity solutions</a> help businesses prepare for inspections with automated documentation and evidence collection. Fines for GDPR violations can reach 4% of global turnover.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
