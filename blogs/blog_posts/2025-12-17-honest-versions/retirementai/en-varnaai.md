<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Your financial advisor just quoted $12,000 for a comprehensive retirement plan. 15-25 hours of CFP time. 2-4 weeks waiting for delivery. And the moment it's finished? It's already outdated because markets moved and your portfolio changed.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Here's what the financial planning industry doesn't advertise: <strong>Most retirement planning is automation-ready.</strong> Monte Carlo simulations? AI runs 10,000 scenarios in seconds. Portfolio optimization? Machine learning analyzes allocations better than manual spreadsheets. Tax strategy? Algorithms identify opportunities human advisors miss.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What Traditional Retirement Planning Actually Costs</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Industry data shows comprehensive retirement planning costs $5,000-$15,000 per plan:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Initial consultation and data gathering: $1,500-$3,000</li>
<li>Portfolio analysis and Monte Carlo projections: $2,000-$5,000</li>
<li>Tax optimization strategy: $1,000-$3,000</li>
<li>Social Security claiming analysis: $500-$1,500</li>
<li>Plan delivery and review meetings: $1,000-$2,500</li>
<li><strong>Total: $5,000-$15,000 per comprehensive plan</strong></li>
</ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>What's worse: Traditional plans are static. Markets change. Your portfolio drifts. New tax laws pass. But your $12,000 plan sits in a drawer getting more outdated every month. Want an update? Pay another $3,000-$5,000 for a plan refresh.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How RetirementAI Works (Without the $12K Price Tag)</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Step 1: Connect Your Portfolio</strong><br>Securely import holdings from Trading212, Interactive Brokers, or major US brokerages. RetirementAI syncs your portfolio automatically - no manual data entry.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Step 2: AI Analysis</strong><br>Machine learning analyzes your asset allocation, identifies concentrated positions (>10% single stock risk), spots high-cost investments dragging returns, and evaluates tax efficiency of account types.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Step 3: Monte Carlo Simulation</strong><br>AI runs 10,000 retirement scenarios using historical market data, inflation assumptions, and your specific withdrawal needs. Get probability-based projections - not unrealistic "average return" fantasies.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Step 4: Tax Optimization</strong><br>RetirementAI identifies tax-loss harvesting opportunities (could save $2,000-$10,000 annually), optimal withdrawal sequencing (401k vs IRA vs Roth vs taxable), and Social Security claiming strategies maximizing lifetime benefits.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Step 5: Continuous Monitoring</strong><br>Unlike static CFP plans, RetirementAI monitors your portfolio daily. Drift alerts when allocations deviate from targets. Market shift warnings when retirement projections change. New tax opportunity notifications.</p>
