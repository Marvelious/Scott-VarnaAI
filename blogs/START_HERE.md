# 🚀 VarnaAI Blog Generation System

## Quick Start: Just Say "go"

When you say **"go"**, I'll ask:
**"What task?"**

Then you tell me:
- **"Generate blog for [website]"** - I'll create a new blog post
- **"Review existing blog"** - I'll check/optimize a published post
- **"Check topic diversity"** - I'll analyze TOPIC_DIVERSITY_MATRIX.md
- **"Add new URLs"** - I'll update URLS.md with new pages

Then I'll execute following the exact workflow.

## The 3-Phase Workflow (Automatic)

### Phase 1: Validation (2 min)
- Check URLS.md for real internal pages
- Verify topic not used before (TOPIC_DIVERSITY_MATRIX.md)
- Plan 7 internal + 3 external links

### Phase 2: Writing (20 min)
- WordPress block format with spacers
- Embed links IN content as I write
- Track focus keyword (18-22 times)
- Break paragraphs at 3 sentences max

### Phase 3: Verification (3 min)
- Focus keyword count correct
- All 10 links embedded in content
- WordPress format with spacing
- External links DOFOLLOW (rel="noopener" only)

---

## File Structure

- **START_HERE.md** ← You are here (the "go" command)
- **URLS.md** ← Real internal pages for 4 websites
- **SAAS_APPS.md** ← Portfolio apps to promote in posts
- **INSTRUCTIONS.md** ← SEO rules and WordPress formatting
- **LESSONS_LEARNED.md** ← Error archive (56K tokens saved)
- **TOPIC_DIVERSITY_MATRIX.md** ← 100+ unique topics

---

## The 3 Critical Rules (Prevent 56K Token Waste)

1. **Embed links IN content** - Not in code blocks
2. **Use WordPress blocks** - With spacers before H2s
3. **External links DOFOLLOW** - rel="noopener" only (NO nofollow)

## Success Metrics

When done right:
- ✅ 100/100 Rank Math score
