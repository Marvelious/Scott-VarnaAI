## 2. About Section (1,000-2,600 characters recommended)

### Version 1: Professional Narrative (520 characters)

```
I help Bulgarian companies adopt AI safely with enterprise-grade security at SME-friendly pricing.

After 17+ years securing systems for Deutsche Bank, Porsche, BASF, and Caterpillar across Europe, I returned to Varna to bring enterprise security expertise to local businesses navigating GDPR, NIS2, and the EU AI Act.

My services include ISO 27001 implementation, GDPR compliance audits, Azure AI integration with data sovereignty, and automated firewall management. I specialize in turning complex compliance requirements into practical solutions that protect your business without breaking the bank.

Based in Varna, serving Bulgarian companies and remote EU clients.

Let's connect if you're exploring AI for your business and want to do it right.

**Tone**: Professional, approachable, value-focused

### Version 2: Results-Focused Approach (740 characters)

```
Do you want to adopt AI for your business but worry about GDPR violations or security risks? I help Bulgarian companies solve this problem.

I've spent 17 years securing enterprise systems for global corporations:
• Deutsche Bank: BaFin-compliant security architecture
• Porsche AG: 200+ supplier network firewall migrations
• BASF: ISO 27001 compliance across 36 global sites
• Caterpillar: 900+ VPN firewalls in Azure with high availability

Now I bring that expertise to Bulgarian SMEs at accessible pricing:
✓ ISO 27001 implementation (not just consulting—actual certification)
✓ GDPR & NIS2 compliance automation (not paperwork, real tools)
✓ Azure AI integration with local data sovereignty
✓ Automated firewall management (save 82% time on security changes)

Based in Varna, Bulgaria. Certified: ISO 27001 Lead Implementer, CCIE Security, Azure AI-102.

Compliance doesn't have to be expensive. Security doesn't have to be complicated.

**Reading Time**: 1 minute
**Tone**: Problem-solving, credibility-building, action-oriented

### Version 3: Story-Driven Approach (860 characters - RECOMMENDED)

```
Most Bulgarian companies want to use AI but hesitate because of GDPR, NIS2, and security concerns. I remove those barriers.

For 17 years, I secured enterprise systems across Europe—Deutsche Bank's BaFin-compliant infrastructure, Porsche's 200-supplier network, BASF's ISO 27001 certification across 36 global sites, Caterpillar's 900+ industrial IoT devices in Azure. I've seen how large enterprises solve compliance challenges with unlimited budgets.

The problem? Bulgarian SMEs face the same regulations but can't afford €200K consulting engagements.

So I created a different approach:
→ ISO 27001 implementation for €4,900 (not €50K+)
→ GDPR compliance automation with our C3 platform (60-second scans, not 6-month audits)
→ Azure AI integration with Bulgarian data sovereignty
→ Automated firewall management (FwChange platform saves 82% time)

Real enterprise security. SME pricing. Bulgarian market focus.

Certifications: ISO 27001 Lead Implementer, CCIE Security, Azure AI-102
Based: Varna, Bulgaria
Serving: Bulgarian companies + remote EU clients

**Tone**: Relatable, problem-solving, educational
**Why Recommended**: Tells a story, addresses specific pain point, positions services as solution
