## Discovery Call Structure (40 minutes total)

### Introduction (5 minutes)

**My Introduction**:
```
"Hi [Name], great to connect! Thanks for making time today.

Just to set context—I spent the last 17 years securing enterprise systems for companies like Deutsche Bank, Porsche, and BASF across Europe. I recently returned to Varna to help Bulgarian companies adopt AI safely with enterprise-grade security at SME-friendly pricing.

Before I dive into how I might help, I'd love to learn more about [Company] and what brought you to this call. Sound good?"
```

**Their Introduction (Ask)**:
- "What does [Company] do, and what's your role there?"
- "How big is your team? How many employees total?"
- "What prompted you to take this call today?" (Listen carefully—this reveals pain)

---

### Discovery Questions (15 minutes)

**🎯 Goal**: Uncover pain points, urgency, budget awareness, decision process

#### **Section 1: Current Challenges (5 min)**

**AI Adoption**:
- "Are you currently using AI in your business, or is it something you're exploring?"
  - *If using*: "What's working well? What's frustrating?"
  - *If exploring*: "What's holding you back from adopting AI?"

**Security/Compliance Pain**:
- "What's your biggest challenge with security or compliance right now?"
- "Have you ever had a security incident or audit finding that was painful to deal with?"
- "Are you aware of the new NIS2 directive that came into effect in October 2024?" (Often: No)
  - *If No*: "It affects about 500-1,000 Bulgarian companies in critical sectors. Compliance deadline is October 2024. Are you in [critical infrastructure/digital services/healthcare/finance]?"

#### **Section 2: Business Impact (5 min)**

**Quantify Pain**:
- "If you could solve [specific challenge they mentioned], what would that mean for your business?"
- "What happens if you don't address this? What's the risk?" (GDPR fines, lost customers, audit failures, etc.)
- "Have you calculated the cost of compliance failures?" (e.g., GDPR fines up to 4% of global revenue)

**Timeline & Urgency**:
- "Is this something you need to address in Q1 2026, or is it more of a long-term goal?"
- "What would need to happen for this to become a top priority?" (Trigger events: audit scheduled, customer demand, regulatory deadline)

#### **Section 3: Decision Process (5 min)**

**Budget Awareness**:
- "Have you budgeted for security or compliance work this year?"
- "When you've engaged consultants before, what price range have you worked with?"
  - *(Frame expectations)*: "Just for context, my audit services start at €980. Full implementations are in the €4,900-€9,800 range depending on scope. Does that align with your expectations?"

**Decision Authority**:
- "Who else would be involved in a decision like this?" (IT Director, CFO, CEO?)
- "What's your typical process for engaging external consultants?" (RFP, informal quotes, single vendor?)
- "If we find a good fit today, what would the timeline look like from decision to kick-off?"

---

### Value Demonstration (10 minutes)

**🎯 Goal**: Show credibility and relevance to their specific situation

**Relevant Case Study (3-4 min)**:
```
"Let me share a relevant example. I recently worked with [anonymized case study matching their industry]:

[Share 90-second verbal story from case study docs]

The key result was [specific metric: 82% time reduction, zero audit findings, €400K savings].

Does something like that resonate with your situation?"
```

**Live Demo (if applicable) (3-4 min)**:
```
"Would it be helpful to show you our C3 compliance tool in action?

[Screen share c3.varnaai.com]

This is what a 60-second GDPR scan looks like. You answer basic questions about your data processing, and it generates instant compliance reports in Bulgarian.

[Show demo scan]

This is the entry point for many clients—they start with a free scan, see the gaps, then engage me to fix them. Interested in trying it after this call?"
```

**Credibility Signals (2-3 min)**:
- Certifications: ISO 27001 Lead Implementer, CCIE Security, Azure AI-102
- Experience: 17 years with Fortune 500 companies across Europe
- Tools: Purpose-built platforms (C3 Compliance, FwChange automation)
