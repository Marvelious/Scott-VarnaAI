## Quality Check (Before Calling it Done)

For each company, ask yourself:
- [ ] Do they have 10+ employees? (not a solo freelancer)
- [ ] Are they in a good industry? (tech, finance, healthcare, manufacturing)
- [ ] Did I find a decision maker name?
- [ ] Did I find their LinkedIn?
- [ ] Would Dad want to talk to them about security/AI?

If yes to most of these = Good lead!

## Examples

### Good Entry
| Field | Example |
|-------|---------|
| Company | Prime Holding JSC |
| Website | primeholding.com |
| Industry | Tech |
| Size | Medium (51-200) |
| What They Do | Software development and digital products |
| City | Varna |
| Decision Maker | [Name from LinkedIn] |
| Title | CEO |
| LinkedIn | linkedin.com/in/... |
| Priority | Hot |
| Notes | Big IT company, probably needs security |

### Bad Entry (Don't Add These)

## Remember

- **Quality over quantity** - 50 good leads beat 200 bad ones
- **It's okay to skip** - If you can't find info, move to next company
- **Save your work often** - Google Sheets auto-saves, but check
- **Take breaks** - Research is tiring, 2-3 hours max per sitting

Good luck!
