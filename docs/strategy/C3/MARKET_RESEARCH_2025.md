- **Q3 2025**: Expected final voting and enactment (currently awaiting second reading)
- **Mid-2026**: [Registration portal and audits expected to begin](https://www.nis2-cyber.com/countries/bg)

**Delays:** [Bulgaria's legislative progress constrained by political transitions, including dissolution of 50th National Assembly and caretaker government](https://ceelegalmatters.com/briefings/28158-bulgaria-s-cybersecurity-where-nis2-and-a-government-are-both-on-hold)

#### EU Commission Pressure

[On May 7, 2025, the European Commission sent a reasoned opinion to Bulgaria](https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/nis2-directive-bulgaria) (and 18 other Member States) for failing to notify full NIS2 transposition. Bulgaria has **2 months to respond** or face referral to the Court of Justice of the European Union.

#### Bulgarian Scope

- **Minimum cybersecurity measures** via government ordinances (to be issued within 8 months of Act entry into force)
- **Triennial audits** similar to German model
- **Tiered penalties** mirroring EU expectations (up to €10 million or 2% turnover)

#### ISO 27001 Synergy

[If an entity already has ISO 27001 certification, NIS2 compliance is significantly easier](https://www.sgs.com/en-bg/news/2024/02/exploring-nis2-and-how-iso-iec-27001-can-help). The global standard provides necessary overview and demonstrates existing compliance with some NIS2 requirements.
