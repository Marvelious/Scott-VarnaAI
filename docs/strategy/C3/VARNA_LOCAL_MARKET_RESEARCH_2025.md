"Благодаря, че отделихте време днес. Целта на тази среща е да проверим дали NIS2 директивата се прилага за [Company Name] и какви стъпки са необходими за съответствие. Това е напълно безплатна оценка без задължения.

Може ли да ви задам няколко въпроса за вашата IT инфраструктура?"

Translation:
"Thank you for making time today. The purpose of this meeting is to check whether NIS2 directive applies to [Company Name] and what steps are needed for compliance. This is completely free assessment with no obligations.

May I ask you a few questions about your IT infrastructure?"
```

**Key Questions** (Ask ALL 5):

1. **Sector**: "В кой сектор работи [Company]? (транспорт, IT, здравеопазване, производство)"
   *Which sector does [Company] operate in? (transport, IT, healthcare, manufacturing)*

2. **EU Operations**: "Имате ли клиенти или операции в ЕС?"

#### Section 2: Live C3 Platform Scan (2 minutes)

**Demo Script**:
```
"Сега ще ви покажа нашата C3 платформа. Тя автоматично сканира вашата IT инфраструктура за съответствие с NIS2 и GDPR. Това отнема само 60 секунди."

Translation:
"Now I'll show you our C3 platform. It automatically scans your IT infrastructure for NIS2 and GDPR compliance. This takes only 60 seconds."
```

**Live Demo Steps**:

1. **Open C3 platform** on laptop (pre-logged in)
2. **Click "New Assessment"** button
3. **Enter company name** (their name, not demo data)
4. **Start scan** (60-second progress bar animation)
5. **Results appear**: Show compliance score (e.g., "42% NIS2 compliant")

**Key Visual**: Point to red/yellow/green indicators on dashboard

**Explain Results** (Bulgarian):
```
"Виждате ли тук? [Company] е 42% съответстващо на NIS2. Червените полета са критични пропуски. Жълтите са предупреждения. Зелените показват, че сте на прав път."

Translation:
"Do you see here? [Company] is 42% NIS2 compliant. Red fields are critical gaps. Yellow are warnings. Green shows you're on right track."
```

---

#### Section 3: Results Explanation (15 minutes)

**Gap Analysis** (10 minutes):

**Walk Through Top 3 Critical Gaps**:

1. **Example Gap 1: No Incident Response Plan**
   ```
   "Червено поле #1: Няма план за реагиране при инциденти. NIS2 изисква документиран процес за справяне с кибератаки в рамките на 24 часа. Ако това липсва, глобата започва от €10 милиона."

   Translation:
   "Red field #1: No incident response plan. NIS2 requires documented process for handling cyberattacks within 24 hours. If this is missing, fine starts at €10 million."
   ```

2. **Example Gap 2: No Data Encryption**
   ```
   "Червено поле #2: Липсва криптиране на данни. Чувствителните данни трябва да бъдат шифровани както при съхранение, така и при предаване."

   Translation:
   "Red field #2: No data encryption. Sensitive data must be encrypted both at rest and in transit."
   ```

3. **Example Gap 3: No Regular Backups**
   ```
   "Червено поле #3: Няма редовни резервни копия. NIS2 изисква автоматични бекъпи всеки ден с офсайт съхранение."

   Translation:
   "Red field #3: No regular backups. NIS2 requires automatic daily backups with offsite storage."
   ```

**Budget Estimate** (3 minutes):

**Present 3 Options**:

| Option | Description | Timeline | Cost |
|--------|-------------|----------|------|
| **Full Audit** | Complete gap analysis document (German standards) | 5 business days | 980 лв (~€500) |
| **Managed Compliance** | Monthly monitoring + fixes + documentation | Ongoing | 290 лв/месец (~€150/mo) |
| **DIY with C3** | Platform access only (you implement fixes) | Self-paced | 150 лв/месец (~€75/mo) |

**Script**:
```
"Имате три опции за постигане на съответствие. Пълният одит ви дава пътна карта за 5 дни. Управляваното съответствие означава, че ние се грижим за всичко. DIY е, ако имате IT екип, който да изпълнява препоръките."

Translation:
"You have three options to achieve compliance. Full audit gives you roadmap in 5 days. Managed compliance means we handle everything. DIY is if you have IT team to implement recommendations."
```

**Compliance Timeline** (2 minutes):

**Show Visual Timeline**:
```
Днес ----------> Юни 2026 (NIS2 deadline) ----------> Юли 2026 (глоби активни)
          6 месеца                            Fines active
```

**Script**:
```
"От днес до юни 2026 имате 6 месеца. Типична имплементация на NIS2 за [Company size] отнема 3-4 месеца. Ако започнете в януари, ще приключите преди крайния срок с 2 месеца резерв."

Translation:
"From today to June 2026 you have 6 months. Typical NIS2 implementation for [Company size] takes 3-4 months. If you start in January, you'll finish before deadline with 2 months buffer."
```

#### Section 4: Next Steps & Trial Close (8 minutes)

**Objection Pre-Emption** (3 minutes):

**Address Common Concerns Proactively**:

1. **"We need to think about it"** → Pre-empt:
   ```
   "Разбирам. Много компании казват това. Въпросът е дали 6-месечното отлагане си струва рискът от €10 милиона глоба. Какво ви пречи да започнете с одита за 980 лв?"

   Translation:
   "I understand. Many companies say that. Question is whether 6-month delay is worth €10 million fine risk. What prevents you from starting with 980 лв audit?"
   ```

2. **"We have IT consultant"** → Pre-empt:
   ```
   "Отлично! Вашият IT консултант може да работи с нашата C3 платформа. Ние предоставяме автоматизацията и документацията на германските стандарти. Той изпълнява техническите корекции."

   Translation:
   "Excellent! Your IT consultant can work with our C3 platform. We provide automation and German-standard documentation. He implements technical fixes."
   ```

3. **"Too expensive"** → Pre-empt:
   ```
   "Нека го видим като инвестиция. NIS2 глоба = €10 милиона. Дори 1% риск = €100,000 очаквана загуба. Управляваното съответствие струва €1,800/година. ROI е 55×."

   Translation:
   "Let's view it as investment. NIS2 fine = €10 million. Even 1% risk = €100,000 expected loss. Managed compliance costs €1,800/year. ROI is 55×."
   ```

**Trial Close Questions** (3 minutes):

**Ask in This Order**:

1. **Interest Check**:
   "Виждате ли стойността на това за [Company]?"
   *Do you see the value of this for [Company]?*

2. **Budget Check**:
   "Имате ли бюджет за compliance в тази година?"
   *Do you have budget for compliance this year?*

3. **Authority Check**:
   "Вие ли вземате решението за това, или трябва да се консултирате с някой друг?"
   *Do you make the decision on this, or do you need to consult someone else?*

4. **Timeline Check**:
   "Кога бихте искали да започнете - тази седмица или следващата?"
   *When would you like to start - this week or next week?*

**Calendar Booking** (2 minutes):

**If Interest Confirmed**:

- [ ] Open Google Calendar on phone
- [ ] Offer 2 specific times: "Вторник 10:00 или сряда 14:00?"
- [ ] Book immediately while in meeting
- [ ] Send calendar invite before leaving

**If "Need to Think"**:

- [ ] Ask: "Какво конкретно трябва да обмислите? Може би мога да помогна сега."
- [ ] Offer: "Мога да ви изпратя пълния доклад от оценката по имейл за вътрешно обсъждане?"
- [ ] Set follow-up: "Кога мога да се обадя - в петък или в понеделник?"
