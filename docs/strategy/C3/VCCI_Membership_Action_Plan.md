   Член сме на ВБТПП от 2025 година..."

## Troubleshooting

**Q: What if I can't get a recommendation from existing member?**
A: Apply anyway - recommendation is helpful but not mandatory. Build relationships after joining.

**Q: What if membership fee is higher than €500?**
A: Negotiate with Managing Committee - explain you're a solo consultant starting operations in Bulgaria. Many chambers have reduced rates for startups.

**Q: What if Managing Committee rejects application?**
A: Rare for legitimate businesses. If rejected, ask for feedback and reapply after addressing concerns.

**Q: Do I need Bulgarian language proficiency?**
A: Helpful but not required. VCCI staff often speak English. Bring Bulgarian-speaking friend to first meeting if needed.
