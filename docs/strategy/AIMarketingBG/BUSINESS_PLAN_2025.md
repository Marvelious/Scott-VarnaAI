## Executive Summary

### The Opportunity

Bulgaria ranks **LAST in the EU** for digital adoption (29.3% vs 54.6% EU average). Only 3.6% of Bulgarian SMEs use AI tools. This creates a massive opportunity for AI-powered marketing services in a market that knows it's behind but doesn't know how to catch up.

### Our Approach

Launch AI Marketing BG as a **tourism-focused AI marketing agency** in Varna, targeting the 300+ hotels in the Black Sea region. Position on **results and ROI**, not technology buzzwords.

### Financial Summary

| Annual Revenue | €60-80K | €150-200K | €300-400K |
| Gross Margin | 70% | 75% | 80% |

### Investment Required

- **Year 1:** €27,000 (Bulgarian BD €12K + marketing €9K + tools €6K)
- **Break-even:** Month 10-12
- **ROI:** 200-300% by end of Year 2

> ⚠️ **CRITICAL DEPENDENCY**: Founder does not speak Bulgarian.
