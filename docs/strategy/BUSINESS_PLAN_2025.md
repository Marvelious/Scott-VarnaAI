# VarnaAI Strategic Business Plan 2025-2026

**Company**: Classic Security EOOD (VarnaAI Portfolio)
**Plan Type**: Consulting-First Strategic Roadmap
**Period**: January 2026 - December 2026
**Version**: 2.0
**Created**: December 2025
**Updated**: December 26, 2025

---

## Strategic Pivot Summary

**FROM**: SaaS product sales (4 apps, €10K MRR target)
**TO**: Consulting services first, SaaS demos later

**Rationale**:
- Bulgarian SMEs want "someone to do it for them" (service, not software)
- First sale takes 3-6 months of relationship building
- Face-to-face meetings are mandatory in Bulgarian business culture
- Single founder cannot simultaneously maintain 4 SaaS + do sales
- Consulting revenue is faster (no product-market fit delay)

---

## Current State (December 2025)

### Infrastructure Status

| Asset | Status | Action |
|-------|--------|--------|
| **VarnaAI.com** | ✅ Active | Primary business card site |
| **ClassicSecurity.net** | ✅ Active | Consulting brand foundation |
| **AI Marketing BG** | ✅ Active | Bulgarian market presence |
| **AI Projektmanager** | 🟡 Dormant | WordPress running, no development |
| **Varna Agenten** | 🟡 Dormant | WordPress running, no development |
| **Hetzner VPS** | ❌ **OFFLINE** | Shutdown complete - demos archived |
| **SaaS Demos** | 📦 Archived | Static landing pages on All-Inkl |

### SaaS Products (Archived for Later)

| Product | Status | When to Revive |
|---------|--------|----------------|
| **RetirementAI** | Static landing page | Q3 2026+ |
| **FwChange** | Static landing page | Q3 2026+ |
| **C3 Compliance** | Static landing page | Q3 2026+ |
