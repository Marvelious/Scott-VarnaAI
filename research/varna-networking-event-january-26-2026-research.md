## 📋 Status Tracking

**Current Status** (December 21, 2025):
- ✅ Research completed
- ✅ VCCI contact information obtained
- ⏳ Event platforms identified
- ⏳ Monitoring strategy planned
- 🔴 Specific January 26 event NOT YET IDENTIFIED

**Next Milestone**: January 6, 2026 - Follow up research

---

## ⚠️ Important Context

**From C3 Action Plan**:
- **Current Status**: Planning paused - awaiting Varna return timeline
- **Blocked Until**: Founder confirms Varna return date, physical presence in Bulgaria

**Implication**: Event research is preparatory work. Actual registration and attendance depends on Big Dick's return to Varna.

**Decision Point**: Confirm Varna return timeline before:
- Registering for VCCI membership (€200-500)
- Committing to attend specific events
- Organizing own meetup

---

## 📝 LinkedIn Post Update Needed

**Current Post #10 (January 22, 2026)** says:
```
I'll be at [Varna Business Network Event] this Saturday (January 26) – let's connect in person!
```

**Action Required**:
- **If event found**: Replace `[Varna Business Network Event]` with actual event name
- **If no event by January 15**: Consider Option A (create own meetup) or Option B (reschedule)
- **If attendance uncertain**: Pivot to individual meetings (Option C)
