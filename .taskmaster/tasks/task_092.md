### Elevator Pitch (2 Minutes):
```
"Hi, I'm Gennadius, AI security specialist here in Varna.

I help Bulgarian companies adopt AI safely with enterprise-grade security and GDPR compliance.

I spent 17 years securing systems for companies like Deutsche Bank, Porsche, and BASF - now I bring that expertise to local businesses at accessible pricing.

Most companies want to use AI but worry about GDPR violations or security risks. I solve that problem.

For example, [pick relevant case study based on their industry] ...

What about you - is your company exploring AI, or are you more focused on traditional security?"

[Listen to their response, ask follow-up questions]

"Would you be open to a quick 30-minute call next week to explore if I can help? I can run a free compliance scan for you..."

[Exchange business cards, book discovery call or connect on LinkedIn]
```

### Conversation Starters:
- "What's your biggest challenge with security or compliance right now?"
- "Have you looked into AI for your business, or is it still on the radar?"
- "What brought you to this event today?"
- "How long have you been in Varna / working in [their industry]?"

### Follow-Up Protocol:
**Within 24 hours** of event:
1. LinkedIn connection request (personalized message referencing conversation)
2. Email follow-up (use template from Task 88)
3. If discovery call booked: Send calendar invite immediately

1. **Introduction** (1 min): Who you are, what you do
2. **Discovery** (2-3 min): Ask about their business, challenges
3. **Value hint** (1 min): Relevant case study or insight
4. **Next step** (30 sec): Exchange cards, book follow-up, or LinkedIn connect

- **Minimum**: 15 business cards collected, 3 meaningful conversations
