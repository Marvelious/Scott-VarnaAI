## Sales Talking Points / Ключови точки за продажби

### Objection: "It's expensive"
**Response:**
"Consultant quotes start at €3,000-5,000. Our pilot is €500 - that's
10× more affordable. Plus, you get ongoing monitoring included."

### Objection: "We'll do it ourselves"
**Response:**
"You can try, but NIS2 has 120+ requirements. Most companies spend
3-6 months on DIY and still miss critical gaps. Our scan takes 60 seconds."

### Objection: "We have time until 2026"
**Response:**
"The deadline is June 2026, but preparation takes 6-12 months.
Companies starting now have the advantage. And prices will rise as the deadline approaches."

### Objection: "Need to think about it"
**Response:**
"Completely understand. Let me send you the scan results by email -
no commitment. You'll see exactly what gaps you have, and then decide."
