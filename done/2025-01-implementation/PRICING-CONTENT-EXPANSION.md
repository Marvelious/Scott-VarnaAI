**Yes!** You can upgrade or downgrade your plan at any time. Upgrades take effect immediately with prorated billing. Downgrades take effect at your next renewal date, and you'll continue enjoying your current plan's features until then.

### What happens to my data if I cancel?

You can export ALL your project data in standard formats (JSON, CSV, PDF) before canceling. We retain your data for 30 days after cancellation for recovery purposes, then permanently delete it from our EU servers. You can also request immediate deletion by contacting privacy@varnaai.com.

### Do you offer discounts for annual subscriptions?

**Yes!** Annual subscriptions receive **2 months free** (16.7% discount). For example, the Basic plan costs €250/month or €2,500/year (saving €500). Annual plans also include priority support and our 14-day money-back guarantee.
