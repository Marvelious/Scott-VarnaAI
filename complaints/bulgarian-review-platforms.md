- Unverified claims
- Emotional language
- Threats or harassment

## Timing Strategy

1. **Demand Letter First**: Give contractor chance to refund
2. **Wait Period**: 7-14 days for response
3. **Post Reviews**: If no refund/resolution
4. **Stagger Posts**: Spread across platforms over 2-3 days
5. **Update Reviews**: If situation resolves, update or remove
