## Competitive Analysis

### Existing Solutions
1. **Verbraucherzentrale (Germany)**: Free templates, but generic and complex
2. **Rechtecheck.de (Germany)**: Legal advice platform (€€€)

4. **ChatGPT/Claude**: Can generate letters, but no structure or legal safety

### Our Competitive Advantages
- **Localized**: Bulgarian + German legal references
- **Guided Process**: Step-by-step vs overwhelming blank form
- **Platform Lists**: Auto-generated review site recommendations
- **Legal Safety**: AI ensures no defamatory language
- **Escalation Roadmap**: Beyond just letter writing

## Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| **Legal Liability** - User sues business, claims app advice caused harm | High | Disclaimer: "Not legal advice", encourage lawyer consultation for high-stakes cases |
| **Defamation Claims** - Generated letter contains defamatory content | High | AI filters for factual language only, user review before sending |
| **Low Adoption** - Users don't trust AI-generated legal content | Medium | Show example letters, testimonials, explain legal safety features |
| **Platform Bans** - Review sites block mass-generated complaints | Medium | Encourage manual posting, personalization of reviews |
| **GDPR Violations** - Store personal data without proper consent | High | Minimal data collection, clear consent, GDPR-compliant hosting |

## Open Questions

1. **Freemium vs Paid**: Should MVP be 100% free to maximize adoption?
2. **AI Provider**: OpenAI (expensive, high quality) vs Anthropic Claude (cheaper, similar quality)?
3. **Localization**: Should we support English from day 1 or focus on BG/DE only?
4. **Legal Review**: Should we hire Bulgarian/German lawyer to review generated content?
5. **Platform Partnerships**: Can we partner with consumer protection organizations for credibility?

---

## Next Steps

1. **Market Research**: Survey Bulgarian/German consumers about complaint writing pain points
2. **Legal Consultation**: One-hour call with Bulgarian + German consumer protection lawyer
3. **Platform Research**: Complete list of German review platforms
4. **Wireframing**: Design MVP user flow in Figma
5. **Tech Stack Decision**: Confirm OpenAI vs Claude for letter generation
